# Chef Sugar

On 2019-09-17, [Chef was found][1] to have [entered into an agreement][2] with US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), best known for their inhumane treatment, denial of basic human rights, and detaining children in cages.

In response, I have removed my code from the Chef ecosystem. I have a moral and ethical obligation to prevent my source from being used for evil.


## What can I do?

You can contact Chef and tell them you do not approve of this contract. If you
are a paying Chef customer, you can tell your sales representative.


## You suck!

I apologize for the disruption to your workflow. I will be happy to restore the old repository and gem versions if Chef cancels their contract with the agency.
